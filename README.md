### Back end & Front end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and npm installed locally on your machine.

### Back-end Installation ###

From the "backend" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You can then run the server with either `node server` or `nodemon server`. The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server start, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### .env file config ###
Edit the .env file with the informations needed, everything need to be filled.
Make sure to not share this .env file with your data publicly.

### Front-end Installation ###

From the "frontend" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You can then run the site with `npm start`. The site should run on `localhost` with default port `3001`. If the site runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server start, e.g. `Listening on port 3002`.

### MySQL DataBase ###

Structure database of the project is shared inside the folder, use it in order to test the site. I used MySQL Workbench to edit/export it into a .sql file, either use MySQL Workbench or the SQL Database Editor of your choice.
